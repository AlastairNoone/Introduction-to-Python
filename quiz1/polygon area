##There are several ways to calculate the area of a 
#regular polygon. Given the number of sides, n, and 
#the length of each side, s, the polygon's area is

#¼ n s2 / tan(π/n).

#For example, a regular polygon with 5 sides, each of length 
#7 inches, has area 84.3033926289 square inches.
#
#Write a function that calculates the area of a 
##regular polygon, given the number of sides and length
#of each side. Submit the area of a regular polygon with 7
#sides each of length 3 inches. Enter a number 
#(and not the units) with at least four digits of
#precision after the decimal point.

#Note that the use of inches as the unit of measurement 
#in these examples is arbitrary. Python only keeps track 
#of the numerical values, not the units.

def poly_gon(n,s):
    poly_gon = (.25 *n* s**2) / (math.tan(math.pi/n))
    return poly_gon


print poly_gon (7,3)
